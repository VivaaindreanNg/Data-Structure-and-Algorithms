# TODO: Backtracking Algorithm for Subset Sum

"""
Problem 1)
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Subset-Sum-Problem

Input: This algorithm takes a set of numbers, and a sum value.
The Set: {10, 7, 5, 18, 12, 20, 15}
The sum Value: 35

Output: All possible subsets of the given set, where sum of
each element for every subsets is same as the given sum value.
{10, 7, 18}
{10, 5, 20}
{5, 18, 12}
{20, 15}



Problem 2)
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/subset-sum-problem2014/1

Given an array arr[] of size N, check if it can be partitioned into two parts
such that the sum of elements in both parts is the same.

Example 1:
Input: N = 4
arr = {1, 5, 11, 5}
Output: YES
Explaination: The two parts are {1, 5, 5} and {11}.


Example 2:
Input: N = 3
arr = {1, 3, 5}
Output: NO
Explaination: This array can never be partitioned into two such parts.
